    <h1 style="margin-top: 100px;">About Me</h1>
    <p class="revealUp" style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 50px;">
        I am Doruk Alp Uzunarslan -I suppose you know that by now- and I live in Istanbul, Turkey. I am currently 14
        years old. I am a student in Üsküdar Amerikan Lisesi (also known as Uskudar American Academy). I also have
        graduated from T3 (Türkiye Teknoloji Takımı [Turkey Technology Team] : An instuition that aims 'brightest'
        students from Turkey to gather in one place) and still going to BILSEM (Bilim ve Sanat Merkezi [Science and Art
        Center]: A project by the Ministry of Education where only some students who have shown significantly higher
        thinking capabilities than normal students are allowed to enter).
        Throughout my
        life, I have tried to attend as many competitions and festivals as I can. You can see the list of my
        achievements from <a href="/dorukalpuzunarslan.co/qualifications" style="color: #DADADA; font-weight: bold">here</a>.

        I am highly engaged with science and technology. I know everyone says that but I MEAN it. I have worked with
        amazing university teachers such as Bogazici University, Acibadem University, Marmara University and many more
        even though I am in high school. I have written many projects to TUBITAK and Teknofest as I had mentioned in my
        <a href="/dorukalpuzunarslan.co/qualifications" style="color: #DADADA; font-weight: bold">Qualifications</a> page. I am always open for
        new things and projects so contact me through <a href="/dorukalpuzunarslan.co/contact" style="color: #DADADA; font-weight: bold">My Contacts</a> if you have any questions or
        offers!
